## Tetris built with Phaser
A phaser based version of tetris.

### Requirements
- [git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - optional if you have a local web server

This project uses npm to manage project dependencies. If you do not have nodejs installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Because this is a web based game, the source code will need to be run on a server in order to play the game. A simple way to run a local server is by using python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html). To do this, you should have python 2.7 installed. You can download python 2.7 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup Instructions
To get the game up and running on your own machine perform the following commands in a terminal.

First, clone from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/thrabchak/tetris-phaser.git

Next, install the project dependencies:

    npm install

Finally start your server:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081 .

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8081 to play the game :)
